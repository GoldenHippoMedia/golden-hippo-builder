# Changesets

This folder is managed by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

Changeset files are added here when developers run `npx changeset` to describe their changes. These files are consumed during the release process to determine version bumps and generate changelogs.

See [wiki/versioning-and-publishing.md](../wiki/versioning-and-publishing.md) for the full workflow.
